    "Abstract": "Simultaneous removal of sulfide ($S^{2-}$), nitrate ($NO_3^-$) and acetate ($Ac^-$) under denitrifying sulfide removal process (DSR) is a novel biological wastewater treatment process. This work developed a mathematical model to describe the kinetic behavior of sulfur–nitrogen–carbon and interactions between autotrophic denitrifiers and heterotrophic denitrifiers. The kinetic parameters of the model were estimated via data fitting considering the effects of initial $S^{2-}$ concentration, $S^{2-}$/$NO_3^-$-N ratio and $Ac^-$-C/$NO_3^-$-N ratio. Simulation supported that the heterotrophic denitratation step ($NO_3^-$ reduction to $NO_2^-$) was inhibited by $S^{2-}$ compared with the denitritation step ($NO_2^-$ reduction to $N_2$). Also, the $S^{2-}$ oxidation by autotrophic denitrifiers was shown two times lower in rate with $NO_2^-$ as electron acceptor than that with $NO_3^-$ as electron acceptor. $NO_3^-$ reduction by autotrophic denitrifiers occurs 3–10 times slower when $S^0$ participates as final electron donor compared to the $S^{2-}$-driven pathway. Model simulation on continuous-flow DSR reactor suggested that the adjustment of hydraulic retention time is an efficient way to make the reactor tolerating high $S^{2-}$ loadings. The proposed model properly described the kinetic behaviors of DSR processes over wide parametric ranges and which can offer engineers with basis to optimize bioreactor operation to improve the treatment capacity.",

    "CLAUDE_What_are_the_points_that_can_be_explored_further": "Based on the paper's findings and limitations, the following points can be explored further:\n\n- **Microbial community dynamics**: The model treats autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers as lumped groups. Future work could incorporate microbial community structure analysis (e.g., metagenomics) to link specific microbial populations to kinetic parameters, improving model accuracy.\n\n- **Temperature and pH effects**: The current model was developed at a fixed temperature (30°C) and pH (7.5). Incorporating temperature and pH correction factors (e.g., Arrhenius-type expressions) would extend the model's applicability to real-world conditions.\n\n- **Intermediate sulfur species**: The model simplifies sulfur transformations by focusing on $S^{2-}$, $S^0$, and $SO_4^{2-}$. The role of intermediate species such as $S_2O_3^{2-}$ (thiosulfate) and polysulfides in the DSR process could be explicitly modeled.\n\n- **$NO_2^-$ accumulation and $N_2O$ emissions**: The model does not explicitly account for $N_2O$ production, which is a potent greenhouse gas. Extending the model to include $N_2O$ kinetics (similar to extensions of ASM models by Ni et al. [42]) would be environmentally significant.\n\n- **Granular sludge biofilm modeling**: The current model is based on suspended/batch culture kinetics. Extending it to a biofilm or granular sludge model (considering mass transfer limitations within granules) would better represent the EGSB reactor used in practice.\n\n- **Long-term sludge adaptation and microbial competition**: The model uses fixed yield coefficients and decay rates. Modeling the dynamic competition and adaptation between autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers under varying substrate ratios over long operational periods could provide deeper insights.\n\n- **Real wastewater application**: The model was validated with synthetic wastewater. Validation with real industrial wastewaters (e.g., from petrochemical, mining, or tannery industries) containing complex matrices and inhibitors would test its general applicability.\n\n- **Online monitoring and control integration**: The paper suggests the model could be used for online monitoring and control, but this has not been demonstrated. Implementing the model in a real-time control framework (e.g., model predictive control) for DSR bioreactors is a promising direction.\n\n- **Coupling with anaerobic digestion models**: Integrating the DSR model with ADM1 (Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1) could enable modeling of more complex wastewater treatment systems where sulfide is generated in-situ from sulfate reduction.",
    "CLAUDE_Summarize_the_main_points_of_the_paper": "This paper presents the development, calibration, and validation of a comprehensive mathematical kinetic model for the **Denitrifying Sulfide Removal (DSR)** process, which simultaneously removes $S^{2-}$, $NO_3^-$, and $Ac^-$ from wastewater via mixed-culture autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification. The main points are:\n\n**1. Model Development:**\n- The model describes six biological reaction processes (R1–R6) involving three microbial groups ($X_A$: autotrophic denitrifiers, $X_H$: heterotrophic denitrifiers, $X_I$: inert biomass) and four soluble compounds ($S_{NO_3^-}$, $S_{NO_2^-}$, $S_{S^{2-}}$, $S_{Ac^-}$).\n- Monod-type kinetics with substrate inhibition terms for $S^{2-}$ and $NO_2^-$ were incorporated.\n- The process matrix (Table S2) follows a structure similar to ASM/ADM1 frameworks.\n\n**2. Key Kinetic Findings:**\n- The heterotrophic denitratation step ($NO_3^-$ → $NO_2^-$, R3) is much more strongly inhibited by $S^{2-}$ ($K_{I,S^{2-}}^{R3}$ = 0.181 mg S $L^{-1}$) than the denitritation step ($NO_2^-$ → $N_2$, R4) ($K_{I,S^{2-}}^{R4}$ = 697 mg S $L^{-1}$), by approximately three orders of magnitude.\n- $S^{2-}$ oxidation by autotrophic denitrifiers is about **2 times slower** with $NO_2^-$ as electron acceptor ($\\mu_{BA}^{R2}$ = 0.135 $h^{-1}$) than with $NO_3^-$ ($\\mu_{BA}^{R1}$ = 0.245 $h^{-1}$).\n- $NO_3^-$ reduction by autotrophic denitrifiers is **3–10 times slower** when $S^0$ is the electron donor ($\\mu_{BA}^{R5}$ = 0.020 $h^{-1}$) compared to the $S^{2-}$-driven pathway.\n- $NO_3^-$ is the preferred electron acceptor over $NO_2^-$ for $S^{2-}$ oxidation.\n\n**3. Model Validation (Three Case Studies):**\n- **Case 1**: Model accurately described DSR kinetics across a wide range of initial $S^{2-}$ concentrations (156–1490 mg $L^{-1}$), with $R^2$ values generally above 0.94 for $S^{2-}$, $NO_3^-$-N, and $Ac^-$-C.\n- **Case 2**: Model successfully reproduced the effects of varying $S^{2-}/NO_3^-$-N ratios (5/2.5 to 5/10) using data from Zhou et al. [30].\n- **Case 3**: Model correctly captured the influence of $Ac^-$-C/$NO_3^-$-N ratios (1.26–3) on the competition between autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers.\n\n**4. Continuous-Flow Reactor Simulation:**\n- Model simulation of a continuous-flow DSR reactor showed that high substrate loading rates and/or high influent $S^{2-}$ reduce removal efficiencies.\n- Adjusting **hydraulic retention time (HRT)** is identified as an efficient strategy to maintain reactor performance under high $S^{2-}$ loadings.\n- $NO_3^-$-N and $Ac^-$-C removal were more sensitive to high loading rates than $S^{2-}$ removal, indicating heterotrophic denitrifiers are more easily inhibited.\n\n**5. Practical Implications:**\n- The model provides a practical tool for the development, optimization, and control of sulfur–nitrogen–carbon removal processes.\n- The model can be simplified to pure heterotrophic or pure autotrophic denitrification by setting respective rate constants to zero.",
