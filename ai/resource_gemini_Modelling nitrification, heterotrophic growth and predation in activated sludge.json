    "Abstract": "A mathematical model describing the interaction between nitrifiers, heterotrophs and predators in wastewater treatment has been developed. The inclusion of a predation mechanism is a new addition to the existing activated sludge models. The developed model considered multi-substrate consumption and multi-species growth, maintenance and decay in a culture where nitrifiers, heterotrophs and predators (protozoa and metazoa) are coexisting. Two laboratory-scale sequenced batch reactors (SBRs) operated at different sludge retention time (SRT) of 30 and 100 days for a period of 4 years were used to calibrate and validate the model. Moreover, to assess the predator activity, a simple procedure was developed, based on measuring the respiration rate with and without the presence of the predators. The model successfully described the performance of two SBRs systems. The fraction of active biomass (ammonia oxidisers, nitrite oxidisers and heterotrophs) predicted by the proposed model was only 33% and 14% at SRT of 30 and 100 days, respectively. The high fraction of inert biomass predicted by the model was in accordance with the microscopic investigations of biomass viability in both reactors. The presented model was used to investigate the effect of increasing sludge age and the role of predators on the biomass composition of the tested SBR system.",
    "GEMINI_What_problem_does_this_paper_attempt_to_solve": "- Current activated sludge models (ASMs) consider bacteria as the sole active biomass, hiding the activities of other microbial community members (like protozoa and metazoa) within a simple decay process.\n- There is a lack of mathematical modeling regarding the interaction between bacteria and other micro-organisms (predators) in the activated sludge microbial community.\n- The specific role of predators (protozoa and metazoa) in wastewater treatment plants is largely under-exposed in academic research, despite their potential to influence plant performance and kinetic parameters.",
    "GEMINI_How_the_paper_solves_this_problem": "- Developed a mathematical model describing the interaction between nitrifiers, heterotrophs, and predators, incorporating multi-substrate consumption and multi-species growth, maintenance, and decay.\n- Introduced a predation mechanism into the ASM framework, treating predators as active biomass that grows aerobically on the degradable fraction of bacteria.\n- Developed a simple experimental procedure using a salt shock (5 g NaCl-Cl/L) to selectively eliminate predators without affecting bacterial activities, allowing for the quantification of predator respiration activity.\n- Calibrated and validated the proposed model using long-term data from two laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) operated at different sludge retention times (SRTs).",
    "GEMINI_What_experiments_were_done_for_the_paper": "- Continuous operation of two laboratory-scale SBRs fed with synthetic ammonia medium at SRTs of 30 and 100 days for a period of 4 years.\n- Respiration activity assays using a biological oxygen monitor (BOM) to measure the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of different biomass fractions.\n- Predator activity determination by measuring respiration under starvation conditions, using a salt shock load to selectively eliminate predators and compare the results.\n- Microscopic investigations and live-dead staining (LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kits) to assess biomass viability, floc size, and the stable presence of protozoa and metazoa.\n- Model simulation and calibration using Aquasim software to fit solid content, respiration rates, and predator activity.",
    "GEMINI_What_are_the_points_that_can_be_explored_further": "- The practical application of the developed model and the assessment of predator activity need to be verified under full-scale activated sludge plant operations.\n- The use of salt as a selective inhibitor for predators under practical conditions requires further investigation, including suitable dosage strategies and the overall effect of predator loss on system performance.\n- The model simplifies all predators into a single type ($X_G$); future research could differentiate between various types of predators if specific kinetic and stoichiometric parameters become available.",
    "GEMINI_Summarize_the_main_points_of_the_paper": "- A novel mathematical model was successfully developed to integrate predation (by protozoa and metazoa) with nitrification and heterotrophic growth in activated sludge systems.\n- A simple, effective salt-shock procedure was established to selectively measure predator activity in suspended mixed cultures without harming bacterial functions.\n- Model simulations and experimental data demonstrated that increasing the SRT (from 30 to 100 days) increases total biomass but significantly decreases the active biomass fraction (from 33% to 14%) due to the accumulation of inert biomass.\n- Simulations revealed that the absence of predators would dramatically increase the active biomass fraction, highlighting the significant impact of predation on biomass composition and oxidation rates.\n- The study emphasizes the need for careful optimization of long-SRT systems (such as membrane bioreactors) to avoid high operational costs associated with inert biomass accumulation without gaining volumetric improvements.",
