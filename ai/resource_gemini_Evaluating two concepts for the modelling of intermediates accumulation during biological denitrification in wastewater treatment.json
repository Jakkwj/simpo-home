    "Abstract": "The accumulation of the denitrification intermediates in wastewater treatment systems is highly undesirable, since both nitrite and nitric oxide (NO) are known to be toxic to bacteria, and nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone depleting substance. To date, two distinct concepts for the modelling of denitrification have been proposed, which are represented by the Activated Sludge Model for Nitrogen (ASMN) and the Activated Sludge Model with Indirect Coupling of Electrons (ASM-ICE), respectively. The two models are fundamentally different in describing the electron allocation among different steps of denitrification. In this study, the two models were examined and compared in their ability to predict the accumulation of denitrification intermediates reported in four different experimental datasets in literature. The N-oxide accumulation predicted by the ASM-ICE model was in good agreement with values measured in all four cases, while the ASMN model was only able to reproduce one of the four cases. The better performance of the ASM-ICE model is due to that it adopts an “indirect coupling” modelling concept through electron carriers to link the carbon oxidation and the nitrogen reduction processes, which describes the electron competition well. The ASMN model, on the other hand, is inherently limited by its structural deficiency in assuming that carbon oxidation is always able to meet the electron demand by all denitrification steps, therefore discounting electron competition among these steps. ASM-ICE therefore offers a better tool for predicting and understanding intermediates accumulation in biological denitrification.",
    "GEMINI_What_problem_does_this_paper_attempt_to_solve": "- The accumulation of denitrification intermediates, specifically $NO_2^-$, NO, and $N_2O$, in wastewater treatment is highly undesirable. \n- The paper aims to evaluate and compare two different mathematical models (ASMN and ASM-ICE) for their ability to predict this accumulation.",
    "GEMINI_How_the_paper_solves_this_problem": "- The paper uses four distinct experimental datasets from literature involving different denitrifying cultures and conditions.\n- It runs simulations using both the ASMN model (\"direct coupling\") and the ASM-ICE model (\"indirect coupling\").\n- The predictions from both models are compared against the actual experimental data to determine which model is more accurate.",
    "GEMINI_What_experiments_were_done_for_the_paper": "- No new experimental data was generated. Instead, the paper relied on four previously published datasets:\n  - Case 1: Pure denitrifying culture (P. denitrificans) fed with glucose.\n  - Case 2: Full-scale activated sludge fed with acetate.\n  - Case 3: Enriched denitrifying culture fed with methanol.\n  - Case 4: Enriched denitrifying culture fed with acetate.",
    "GEMINI_What_are_the_points_that_can_be_explored_further": "- Future work should optimize experimental designs to provide more info on the kinetics of both carbon oxidation and nitrogen reduction processes from different cultures and under different conditions.\n- Comparing and synthesizing parameters from different experiments to form a consistent pattern for ASM-ICE default values.\n- Further improvement/simplification of the ASM-ICE model structure.\n- Gaining more information on the reaction kinetics of nitric oxide (NO) reduction, which is hard to measure.",
    "GEMINI_Summarize_the_main_points_of_the_paper": "- The ASM-ICE model, which uses an \"indirect coupling\" approach with electron carriers, is better at predicting denitrification intermediate accumulation than the ASMN model.\n- The ASMN model fails because it assumes carbon oxidation always meets the electron demand of all denitrification steps, ignoring electron competition.\n- ASM-ICE successfully described the experimental data in all four cases studied, whereas ASMN only succeeded in one.",

    "zh_Abstract": "废水处理系统中反硝化中间产物的积累是非常不希望的，因为已知亚硝酸盐和一氧化氮 (NO) 对细菌有毒，而一氧化二氮 (N2O) 是一种强效温室气体和消耗臭氧层的物质。迄今为止，已经提出了两种截然不同的反硝化建模概念，分别以氮的活性污泥模型 (ASMN) 和带有电子间接耦合的活性污泥模型 (ASM-ICE) 为代表。这两个模型在描述反硝化不同步骤之间的电子分配方面存在根本差异。在这项研究中，检查并比较了这两个模型预测文献中四个不同实验数据集中报告的反硝化中间产物积累的能力。ASM-ICE 模型预测的 N-氧化物积累与所有四种情况下测量的值非常吻合，而 ASMN 模型只能重现四种情况之一。 ASM-ICE 模型的更好性能是由于它采用了通过电子载体连接碳氧化和氮还原过程的“间接耦合”建模概念，很好地描述了电子竞争。另一方面，ASMN 模型固有地受到其结构缺陷的限制，因为它假设碳氧化始终能够满足所有反硝化步骤的电子需求，因此忽略了这些步骤之间的电子竞争。因此，ASM-ICE 为预测和理解生物反硝化中中间产物的积累提供了更好的工具。",
