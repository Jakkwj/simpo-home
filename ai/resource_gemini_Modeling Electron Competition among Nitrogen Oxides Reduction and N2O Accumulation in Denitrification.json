    "Abstract": "Competition for electrons among different steps of denitrification has previously been shown to occur, and to play an important role in the accumulation and emission of N2O in wastewater treatment. However, this electron competition is not recognized in the current denitrification models, limiting their ability to predict N2O accumulation during denitrification. In this work, a new denitrification model is developed for wastewater treatment processes. It describes electron competition among the four steps of denitrification, through modeling the carbon oxidation and nitrogen reduction processes separately, in contrast to the existing models that directly couple these two types of processes. Electron carriers are introduced to link carbon oxidation, which donates electrons to carriers, and nitrogen oxides reduction, which receives electrons from these carriers. The relative ability of each denitrification step to compete for electrons is modeled through the use of different affinity constants with reduced carriers. Model calibration and validation results demonstrate that the developed model is able to reasonably describe the nitrate, nitrite, and N2O reduction rates of a methanol-utilizing denitrifying culture under various carbon and nitrogen oxides supplying conditions. The model proposed, while subject to further validation, is expected to enhance our ability to predict N2O accumulation in denitrification.",

    "zh_Abstract": "之前已经表明，反硝化不同步骤之间的电子竞争会发生，并在废水处理中N2O的积累和排放中起重要作用。然而，目前的脱氮模型并未认识到这种电子竞争，从而限制了它们预测脱氮过程中N2O积累的能力。在这项工作中，为废水处理过程开发了一种新的反硝化模型。它通过分别模拟碳氧化和氮还原过程来描述反硝化四个步骤之间的电子竞争，这与直接将这两种类型的过程耦合的现有模型相反。引入电子载体以连接提供电子给载体的碳氧化，和从这些载体接收电子的氮氧化物还原。通过对还原载体使用不同的亲和常数，来模拟反硝化各步骤竞争电子的相对能力。模型校准和验证结果表明，所建立的模型能够合理描述甲醇利用脱氮培养物在不同碳和氮氧化物供应条件下的硝酸盐、亚硝酸盐和N2O还原率。虽然该模型有待进一步验证，但预计将提高我们预测反硝化中N2O积累的能力。",
