    "Abstract": "The autotrophs in activated sludge play an important role in biological wastewater treatment, especially in the nitrification process. Compared with the heterotrophs in activated sludge, information about the growth, maintenance, and product formation of the autotrophs is still sparse. In this work both experimental and modeling approaches are used to investigate the growth, nitrite inhibition, maintenance, and formation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and soluble microbial products (SMP) of the autotrophs, with nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in activated sludge as an example. The unified theory for EPS and SMP is integrated into our model to describe the microbial product formation of the NOB. Extensive experiments were carried out using the NOB-enriched in a sequencing batch reactor for the calibration and validation of the developed model. Results show that the NOB spend a considerable amount of energy on maintenance processes. Their apparent growth yield is estimated to be 0.044 mg COD biomass mg-1 N. The model simulations reveal that the concentrations of EPS and SMP in the NOB-enriched culture initially increase, but later decrease gradually, and that the SMP formed in the nitrite oxidation process are biodegradable.",
    "GEMINI_What_problem_does_this_paper_attempt_to_solve": "- The lack of information regarding the growth, maintenance, and product formation (EPS and SMP) of autotrophs in activated sludge, compared to heterotrophs.\n- Existing models for nitrite oxidation do not account for organic carbon inhibition, biomass maintenance, and microbial products of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB).\n- The need for a comprehensive model that includes substrate inhibition and SMP formation to better predict soluble organic materials in reactor effluents.",
    "GEMINI_How_the_paper_solves_this_problem": "- Formulated a new mathematical model to describe biomass growth, substrate inhibition, maintenance, death, and the formation of EPS and SMP of autotrophs (using NOB as an example).\n- Integrated the unified theory for EPS and SMP into the model to describe the relationships among solid species (NOB, active heterotrophs, EPS, inert biomass) and soluble species (nitrite, nitrate, UAP, BAP).\n- Conducted extensive batch experiments using an NOB-enriched culture from a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) to calibrate and validate the developed model.\n- Used respirometric methods (OUR measurements) to determine the true growth yield ($Y_N$) and decouple it from maintenance energy requirements.",
    "GEMINI_What_experiments_were_done_for_the_paper": "- Operated a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) fed with synthetic wastewater (nitrite as sole energy source, bicarbonate as carbon source) to selectively enrich NOB.\n- Conducted batch respirometric experiments in 1-L reactors with different initial nitrite concentrations.\n- Measured endogenous and exogenous oxygen uptake rates (OUR) to determine oxygen consumption.\n- Analyzed samples for soluble microbial products (SMP), nitrite-N, nitrate-N, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), and volatile suspended solids (MLVSS).\n- Extracted and quantified extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) using the cation exchange resin (CER) technique.",
    "GEMINI_What_are_the_points_that_can_be_explored_further": "- Further investigation into the exact sources and formation mechanisms of biomass-associated products (BAP), as there are controversial conclusions in the literature (e.g., whether BAP originates solely from EPS hydrolysis or also from cell lysis and soluble intracellular components).\n- Exploring the variation of the apparent growth yield of NOB under different growth conditions, such as varying sludge retention times (SRT) and specific growth rates in full-scale wastewater treatment plants.\n- Extending the model to include other autotrophic populations, such as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), to create a complete two-step nitrification model with EPS and SMP formation.",
    "GEMINI_Summarize_the_main_points_of_the_paper": "- A new model was successfully developed to describe the growth, maintenance, and product (EPS and SMP) formation of NOB.\n- NOB spend a considerable amount of energy on maintenance (estimated at 26.7% of energy generated at maximum growth rate).\n- The apparent growth yield of NOB was estimated to be 0.044 mg COD biomass $mg^{-1}$ N, which is lower than the true yield due to maintenance energy consumption.\n- Model simulations and experimental data showed that EPS and SMP concentrations initially increase during rapid NOB growth but gradually decrease later.\n- SMP formed during the nitrite oxidation process are biodegradable and can be utilized by heterotrophs.",
