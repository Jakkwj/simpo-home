    "Abstract": "An Activated Sludge Model #3 (ASM3) based, pseudomechanistic model describing nitrous oxide (N2O) production was created in this study to provide more insight into the dynamics of N2O production, consumption, and emissions at a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). N2O emissions at the studied WWTP are monitored throughout the plant with a Fourier transform infrared analyzer, while the developed model encountered N2O production in the biological reactors via both ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) nitrification and heterotrophic denitrifiers. Additionally, the stripping of N2O was included by applying a KLa-based approach that has not been widely used before. The objective was to extend the existing ASM3-based model of the plant and assess how well the full-scale emissions could be predicted with the selected model. The validity and applicability of the model were tested by comparing the simulation results with the comprehensive online data. The results show that the ASM3-based model can be successfully extended and applied to modeling N2O production and emissions at a full-scale WWTP. These results demonstrate that the biological reactor can explain most of the N2O emissions at the plant, but a significant proportion of the liquid-phase N2O is further transferred during the process.",
    "GEMINI_What_problem_does_this_paper_attempt_to_solve": "- Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are significant sources of $N_2O$ emissions, a potent greenhouse gas.\\n- Current estimations often rely on fixed emission factors, which are inaccurate, inconsistent, and ignore the impact of varying process conditions.\\n- There is a lack of comprehensive mathematical models applied to full-scale WWTPs using the Activated Sludge Model #3 (ASM3) to predict $N_2O$ production and emissions.\\n- Previous models often overlook the stripping of $N_2O$ (both gaseous and liquid phases) and the contribution of post-aeration processes to the overall $N_2O$ dynamics.",
    "GEMINI_How_the_paper_solves_this_problem": "- Developed an extended ASM3-based pseudomechanistic model to simulate $N_2O$ dynamics.\\n- Included $N_2O$ production pathways via both ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (specifically the $NH_2OH$ oxidation pathway) and heterotrophic denitrification.\\n- Incorporated a $K_La$-based mathematical approach to model the stripping of $N_2O$ from the liquid to the gaseous phase in aerated zones.\\n- Calibrated and validated the model using comprehensive online monitoring data (including liquid-phase $N_2O$ microsensors and gaseous emissions via FTIR) from a full-scale underground WWTP (Viikinmäki WWTP).",
    "GEMINI_What_experiments_were_done_for_the_paper": "- Continuous monitoring of total gaseous $N_2O$ emissions using a Gasmet CEMS II system (FTIR analyzer) in the exhaust air channel.\\n- Online measurement of liquid-phase $N_2O$ concentrations using Clark-type microsensors in specific aerated zones (zones 4 and 6) and a switching zone (zone 3) of the biological reactor.\\n- Collection of hourly grab samples from the influent and effluent of secondary clarifiers and plant effluent to measure liquid-phase $N_2O$.\\n- Model simulation using GPS-X, including steady-state simulation, calibration (over an 11-day period), and validation (over a 5-day period).\\n- Parameter estimation and goodness-of-fit evaluation using residual sum of squares (RSS) and modified Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients.",
    "GEMINI_What_are_the_points_that_can_be_explored_further": "- The contribution of AOB denitrification (nitrifier denitrification) to $N_2O$ emissions, which requires stable nitrogen and oxygen isotope analysis to fully investigate.\\n- The dynamics of $N_2O$ production and consumption in secondary clarifiers, as a significant portion of $N_2O$ might be emitted or consumed there.\\n- The ultimate fate of liquid-phase $N_2O$ that is conveyed to post-denitrifying filtration and receiving water bodies.\\n- Refinement of the stripping model, as the current approach seemed to overestimate stripped $N_2O$ during certain periods.\\n- The applicability of the developed $NH_2OH$ oxidation pathway model to other WWTPs with different environmental conditions (e.g., those with $NO_2^-$ accumulation).",
    "GEMINI_Summarize_the_main_points_of_the_paper": "- An extended ASM3 model was successfully developed and applied to predict $N_2O$ production and emissions at a full-scale WWTP.\\n- The model effectively incorporates $N_2O$ production via AOB ($NH_2OH$ pathway) and heterotrophic denitrification, along with a $N_2O$ stripping mechanism.\\n- Simultaneous liquid-phase measurements demonstrated the model's ability to accurately capture $N_2O$ dynamics in the aeration process.\\n- The study confirms that most $N_2O$ production occurs in the aerated zones of the activated sludge process.\\n- A significant proportion of liquid-phase $N_2O$ is not stripped during aeration but is instead transferred to subsequent processes like secondary clarification and post-filtration.",
