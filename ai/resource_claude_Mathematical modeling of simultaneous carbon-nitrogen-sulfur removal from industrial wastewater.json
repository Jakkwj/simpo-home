The interactions among sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB), facultative bacteria (FB), and methane-producing archaea (MPA) are complex and had not been comprehensively modeled in a single framework.\n- **Competitive inhibition kinetics between SRB and NRB not quantified**: The competitive inhibition coefficients ($K_{I,NO_3}^{SRB}$ and $K_{I,SO_4}^{NRB}$) governing the competition between SRB and NRB for electron donors had not been well estimated and reported.\n- **No unified simulation tool for C-N-S dynamics**: Existing models (ASMs for C-N removal, ADM1 extensions for sulfate reduction) were developed separately and could not simulate the full C-N-S removal process including oxygen/nitrate-driven sulfide oxidation under both anaerobic and micro-aerobic conditions.",
    "CLAUDE_How_the_paper_solves_this_problem": "The paper solves the problem through the following approaches:\n\n- **Integration of ASMs and extended ADM1**: The model was constructed by combining the Activated Sludge Models (ASMs) for carbon and nitrogen removal with an extended Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) for sulfate reduction, supplemented with oxygen/nitrate-driven sulfide oxidation processes.\n- **Comprehensive kinetic network (9 biochemical processes, R1–R9)**:\n  - Process 1 (R1): Heterotrophic $SO_4^{2-}$ reduction by SRB ($SO_4^{2-} \\rightarrow S^{2-}$)\n  - Process 2 (R2, R3): Heterotrophic denitrification by NRB ($NO_3^- \\rightarrow NO_2^- \\rightarrow N_2$)\n  - Process 3 (R4): $S^{2-}$-driven autotrophic denitrification by NR-SOB ($S^{2-} + NO_3^- \\rightarrow S^0 + NO_2^-$)\n  - Process 4 (R5): Micro-aerobic $S^{2-}$ oxidation by SOB ($2HS^- + O_2 \\rightarrow 2S^0 + 2OH^-$)\n  - Process 5 (R6): Acetate-utilizing methanogenesis by MPA\n  - Process 6 (R7): Homoacetogenic reaction by FB\n  - Process 7 (R8, R9): Aerobic lactate/acetate oxidation by FB\n- **Dual-substrate Monod kinetics with inhibition terms**: The model employed dual-substrate Monod kinetics incorporating competitive inhibition coefficients ($K_{I,NO_3}^{SRB}$ for nitrate inhibition on SRB; $K_{I,SO_4}^{NRB}$ for sulfate inhibition on NRB) and substrate inhibition functions for oxygen on denitrification ($K_{I,O_2}^{NRB}$).\n- **Six biomass groups and nine soluble components tracked**: The model tracked $X_{SRB}$, $X_{NRB}$, $X_{SOB}$, $X_{MPA}$, $X_{FB}$, $X_I$ (biomass) and $S_{SO_4}$, $S_{NO_3}$, $S^{2-}$, $S^0$, COD, $Ac^-$, $CH_4$, $O_2$, $NO_2^-$ (soluble components).\n- **Parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis**: Four key parameters ($\\mu_{An,FB}$, $K_S^{SRB}$, $K_{I,NO_3}^{SRB}$, $K_{I,SO_4}^{NRB}$) were estimated by minimizing the sum of squares of deviations between measured data and model predictions using MATLAB. The 95% confidence regions (ellipsoids) were analyzed to confirm parameter identifiability.\n- **Model calibration and validation**: The model was calibrated using one batch test condition and validated against independent data sets under different initial nitrate concentrations (Culture 1) and different oxygen-to-sulfate molar ratios $R_{OS}$ (Culture 2).\n- **Extended application to SR-SO and DSR processes**: The model was further demonstrated to be applicable to simulate the sulfate-reduction sulfide-oxidation (SR-SO) process and the denitrifying sulfide removal (DSR) process by selectively switching off certain pathways.",

    "CLAUDE_What_are_the_points_that_can_be_explored_further": "Based on the limitations and future directions discussed in the paper, the following points can be explored further:\n\n- **Incorporation of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis**: The current model does not consider methane production from $H_2$ by hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Future work could include this pathway when more information on $H_2$ consumption becomes available, making the model more complete for anaerobic digestion scenarios.\n- **Inclusion of sulfate precipitation**: The model ignores the occurrence of chemical precipitation in the presence of $SO_4^{2-}$ in real wastewater (e.g., formation of metal sulfide precipitates). Incorporating precipitation reactions would improve the model's applicability to real industrial wastewater.\n- **More complex and realistic carbon sources**: The current model uses lactate as the sole carbon source to simplify carbon metabolism. Real industrial wastewater contains much more complex organic carbon constituents. Future work should calibrate and validate the model with diverse carbon sources representative of large-scale real systems.\n- **Long-term continuous reactor studies**: The model was calibrated and validated using batch experimental data. Long-term studies in continuous reactors (e.g., EGSB, CSTR) under varying operating conditions would further strengthen model reliability and applicability.\n- **Full-scale application and parameter uncertainty reduction**: The model may not yet serve as a precise quantitative predictor in full-scale C-N-S removal applications due to parameter value uncertainty. More extensive calibration datasets from full-scale systems are needed.\n- **Extension to complete sulfide oxidation to sulfate**: The current model ignores SOB-mediated sulfide oxidation to sulfate ($S^{2-} \\rightarrow SO_4^{2-}$) under electron acceptor-limited conditions. Under excess oxygen conditions, this pathway may become significant and should be incorporated.\n- **Culture-specific competitive inhibition parameters**: The weak-overlap confidence regions for $K_{I,NO_3}^{SRB}$ and $K_{I,SO_4}^{NRB}$ between Culture 1 and Culture 2 suggest these parameters are culture-specific. Further investigation into the mechanisms driving this variability and development of more generalizable parameter estimation approaches is warranted.\n- **Nitrate reduction by SRB**: Ammonium production was not detected in this study, so nitrate use by SRB was excluded. However, some SRB are capable of reducing nitrate to ammonium (DNRA), and this pathway could be explored under different conditions.\n- **Spatial heterogeneity and biofilm modeling**: The current model assumes a well-mixed system. Extending the model to account for spatial gradients in biofilm or granular sludge systems (e.g., EGSB reactors) would improve its predictive capability for real reactor configurations.\n- **Integration with the SDD (simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification) process optimization**: While the model was shown to be applicable to SR-SO and DSR processes, a more detailed optimization study of the SDD process using the model could provide practical guidance for reactor design and operation.",
    "CLAUDE_Summarize_the_main_points_of_the_paper": "The main points of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **First integrated mathematical model for simultaneous C-N-S removal**: This work presented the first successful mathematical modeling of simultaneous carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur removal from industrial wastewater, filling a critical gap in the field.\n\n- **Model framework**: The model was developed by integrating ASMs (for C-N removal) and extended ADM1 (for sulfate reduction), supplemented with oxygen/nitrate-driven sulfide oxidation processes. It tracked six biomass groups ($X_{SRB}$, $X_{NRB}$, $X_{SOB}$, $X_{MPA}$, $X_{FB}$, $X_I$) and nine soluble components ($S_{SO_4}$, $S_{NO_3}$, $S^{2-}$, $S^0$, COD, $Ac^-$, $CH_4$, $O_2$, $NO_2^-$).\n\n- **Dual-substrate Monod kinetics with competitive inhibition**: The model employed dual-substrate Monod kinetics incorporating competitive inhibition between SRB and NRB. The competitive inhibition coefficients $K_{I,NO_3}^{SRB}$ = 225.8 ± 20.3 mg N L$^{-1}$ and $K_{I,SO_4}^{NRB}$ = 327.3 ± 68.7 mg S L$^{-1}$ were estimated and reported for the first time.\n\n- **Successful calibration and validation**: The model was calibrated using batch experimental data and validated against independent datasets under different initial nitrate concentrations (200–700 mg L$^{-1}$) and different oxygen-to-sulfate molar ratios ($R_{OS}$ = 0.39–1.93). The model closely predicted profiles of nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, sulfide, lactate, acetate, methane, elemental sulfur, and oxygen under both anaerobic and micro-aerobic conditions.\n\n- **Good parameter identifiability**: The 95% confidence ellipsoids for all estimated parameter pairs were small and well-centered, with deviations mostly less than ±15% from best-fit values, confirming good parameter identifiability.\n\n- **Biomass distribution analysis**: Steady-state biomass distribution modeling revealed that SRB populations increased in the presence of oxygen (oxygen shielding effect), while SOB numbers increased monotonically with $R_{OS}$. The model explained the apparent inconsistency between NRB numbers and nitrate reduction rates under micro-aerobic conditions.\n\n- **Versatility for related processes**: The model was demonstrated to be feasible for simulating other relevant processes including the sulfate-reduction sulfide-oxidation (SR-SO) process and the denitrifying sulfide removal (DSR) process by selectively activating/deactivating specific pathways.\n\n- **Practical implications**: The model provides a theoretical tool for understanding complex C-N-S dynamics, exploring the effect of operational parameters (e.g., $R_{OS}$, nitrate concentration), and confirming the mechanism of enhanced elemental sulfur ($S^0$) production under limited oxygen conditions.",

    "CLAUDE_zh_Summarize_the_main_points_of_the_paper": "本文的主要内容可总结如下：\n\n- **首个工业废水同步C-N-S去除综合数学模型**：本研究首次成功建立了工业废水中碳、氮、硫同步去除的数学模型，填补了该领域的重要空白。\n\n- **模型框架**：通过整合ASMs（用于C-N去除）和扩展ADM1（用于硫酸盐还原），并补充氧/硝酸盐驱动的硫化物氧化过程，构建了综合模型。模型追踪六类生物量（$X_{SRB}$、$X_{NRB}$、$X_{SOB}$、$X_{MPA}$、$X_{FB}$、$X_I$）和九种溶解组分（$S_{SO_4}$、$S_{NO_3}$、$S^{2-}$、$S^0$、COD、$Ac^-$、$CH_4$、$O_2$、$NO_2^-$）。\n\n- **含竞争抑制的双底物Monod动力学**：模型采用双底物Monod动力学，引入SRB与NRB之间的竞争抑制。首次估算并报道了竞争抑制系数$K_{I,NO_3}^{SRB}$ = 225.8 ± 20.3 mg N L$^{-1}$和$K_{I,SO_4}^{NRB}$ = 327.3 ± 68.7 mg S L$^{-1}$。\n\n- **成功的校准与验证**：模型使用批次实验数据进行校准，并在不同初始硝酸盐浓度（200–700 mg L$^{-1}$）和不同氧硫摩尔比（$R_{OS}$ = 0.39–1.93）的独立数据集上进行验证。模型在厌氧和微好氧条件下均能准确预测硝酸盐、亚硝酸盐、硫酸盐、硫化物、乳酸、乙酸、甲烷、单质硫和氧气的浓度变化曲线。\n\n- **良好的参数可识别性**：所有估计参数对的95%置信椭球均小且以最优值为中心，偏差大多不超过最优值的±15%，确认了参数的良好可识别性。\n\n- **生物量分布分析**：稳态生物量分布建模揭示，SRB种群数量在有氧存在时增加（氧屏蔽效应），而SOB数量随$R_{OS}$单调增加。模型解释了微好氧条件下NRB数量与硝酸盐还原速率之间的表观不一致性。\n\n- **对相关过程的通用性**：通过选择性激活/关闭特定反应路径，模型被证明可用于模拟硫酸盐还原-硫化物氧化（SR-SO）过程和反硝化硫化物去除（DSR）过程。\n\n- **实际意义**：该模型为理解复杂C-N-S动力学、探索操作参数（如$R_{OS}$、硝酸盐浓度）的影响提供了理论工具，并验证了限氧条件下强化单质硫（$S^0$）生产的共识机制。",
