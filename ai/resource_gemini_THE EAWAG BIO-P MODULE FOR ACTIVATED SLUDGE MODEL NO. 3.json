    "Abstract": "An additional module for the prediction of enhanced biological phosphorus removal is presented on the basis of a calibrated version of ASM3. The module uses modified processes from ASM2d but neglects the fermentation of readily degradable substrate. Biomass decay is modeled in the form of endogenous respiration as in ASM3. Moreover, an additional glycogen pool and biologically induced P-precipitation were not taken into account. The module was systematically calibrated with experimental data from various batch experiments, a full-scale WWTP and a pilot plant treating Swiss municipal waste water. A standard parameter set allowed all data to be simulated. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved",
    "GEMINI_What_problem_does_this_paper_attempt_to_solve": "- ASM3 (Activated Sludge Model No. 3) does not include biological phosphorus removal (BPR).\\n- Existing models like ASM2d are complex (include fermentation, glycogen pools, etc.) which might be unnecessary for typical diluted municipal wastewater.\\n- There is a need for a calibrated, simplified module to predict enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) that integrates seamlessly with ASM3.",
    "GEMINI_How_the_paper_solves_this_problem": "- Develops the EAWAG Bio-P module as an add-on to ASM3.\\n- Introduces 4 additional state variables ($S_{PO_4}$, $X_{PAO}$, $X_{PHA}$, $X_{PP}$) and 11 additional processes.\\n- Simplifies ASM2d by neglecting fermentation of readily degradable substrate and omitting an additional glycogen pool and biologically induced P-precipitation.\\n- Models biomass decay as endogenous respiration (consistent with ASM3) and uses lower rates for anoxic decay compared to aerobic decay, neglecting anaerobic decay.\\n- Systematically calibrates the module using an iterative approach with data from batch experiments, a pilot plant, and a full-scale WWTP.",
    "GEMINI_What_experiments_were_done_for_the_paper": "- Batch experiments for PAO decay (aerobic and anaerobic conditions) to study polyphosphate decay and endogenous respiration.\\n- Batch experiments for P-release and P-uptake (aerobic/anoxic) to calibrate kinetic and stoichiometric parameters.\\n- Batch experiments examining the grow-in and wash-out of PAO under different flow schemes (DEN, UCT, AAO).\\n- Full-scale WWTP monitoring (Neugut WWTP) including weekly variations and long-term (9 weeks) simulations.\\n- Pilot plant monitoring (Tüffenwies) including diurnal variations.",
    "GEMINI_What_are_the_points_that_can_be_explored_further": "- Improving the estimation of initial sludge composition (PP and PHA pools) for short-term dynamic simulations.\\n- Incorporating dynamic measurements of readily degradable COD ($S_S$) to total COD ratios, rather than using a constant ratio.\\n- Developing reliable direct measurement methods for internal storage pools like polyphosphate and glycogen to validate the model more accurately.\\n- Including biologically induced inorganic calcium-phosphate precipitation if applied to different wastewater conditions (e.g., higher pH or temperature).",
    "GEMINI_Summarize_the_main_points_of_the_paper": "- The EAWAG Bio-P module successfully extends ASM3 to include biological phosphorus removal.\\n- The module simplifies previous models (like ASM2d) by removing fermentation and glycogen pools, which are shown to be unnecessary for typical Swiss municipal wastewater.\\n- The model distinguishes between aerobic and anoxic growth/yields and uses endogenous respiration for decay.\\n- A single standard parameter set was successfully calibrated and validated against various dynamic conditions (batch, diurnal, weekly, long-term) in both pilot and full-scale plants.",
