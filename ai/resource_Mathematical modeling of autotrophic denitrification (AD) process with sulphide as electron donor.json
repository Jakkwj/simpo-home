    "Abstract": "Autotrophic denitrification (AD) plays a critical role in nitrate removal from organic carbon-deficient wastewaters with a high level of nitrogen oxides. However, the AD process is not included in the current denitrification models, which limits the application of AD technology for wastewater treatment. In this work, a kinetic model for AD process involved 4 processes and 5 components with 9 parameters is established to describe the sulphide biooxidation and nitrite removal process. In this model, 4 oxidationereduction reactions using sulphide as electronic donor in the AD process are taken into account. The model parameters are optimized by fitting data from the experiments with different combinations of sulphide, sulphur, sulphate, nitrate and nitrite at various concentrations. Model calibration and validation results demonstrate that the developed model is able to reasonably describe the removal rates of nitrate, nitrite, sulphide and sulphur in the AD process. The model simulation results also show that the sulphur term (h(S)) in the kinetic equations of nitrate, nitrite, sulphur and sulphate remains constant, rather than being controlled by its own concentration. Furthermore, with this model the products of sulphide biooxidation in the AD process, sulphur and sulphate, and their concentrations can be accurately predicted. Therefore, this model provides a strategy to control the sulphate concentration below the discharge limits or recover sulphur as the main end product from sulphide biooxidation.",

    "CLAUDE_How_the_paper_solves_this_problem": "## How the Paper Solves This Problem\n\nThe paper develops a novel two-step kinetic mathematical model for the AD process using sulphide as electron donor, structured as follows:\n\n### 1. Biochemical Reaction Framework\nThe AD process is represented by **4 oxidation-reduction reactions** (Processes A, B, C, D):\n- **Oxidation (two-step)**: $S^{2-} \\rightarrow S^0 + 2e^-$ and $S^0 + 4H_2O \\rightarrow SO_4^{2-} + 8H^+ + 6e^-$\n- **Reduction (two-step)**: $NO_3^- \\rightarrow NO_2^-$ and $NO_2^- \\rightarrow 0.5N_2$\n- **Cell synthesis**: described by the half-reaction for $C_5H_7O_2N$ formation\n\n### 2. Stoichiometry via Electron Partitioning Framework\nStoichiometric coefficients are derived from the **electron equivalents partitioning framework**, dividing electrons from $S^{2-}/S^0$ oxidation into:\n- $f_e$: fraction transferred to electron acceptors ($NO_3^-$, $NO_2^-$) for energy\n- $f_s$: fraction used for cell synthesis\n\nFour electron distribution coefficients are defined: $f_{S^{2-}}^1$, $f_{S^{2-}}^2$, $f_{S^0}^1$, $f_{S^0}^2$\n\n### 3. Double Monod-Type Kinetic Equations\nA **double Monod-type kinetic model** is used to describe the growth of autotrophic denitrification bacteria (ADB), incorporating both electron donor and electron acceptor concentrations. The model includes **5 components** ($S^{2-}$, $S^0$, $SO_4^{2-}$, $NO_3^-$, $NO_2^-$) and **9 parameters** ($\\mu_{AD}$, $f_{S^{2-}}^1$, $f_{S^{2-}}^2$, $f_{S^0}^1$, $f_{S^0}^2$, $K_{NO_3}$, $K_{NO_2}$, $K_{S^{2-}}$, $\\eta(S)$).\n\n### 4. Determination of the Sulphur Term $\\eta(S)$\nBoth **Monod-type** ($S/(K+S)$) and **constant-type** expressions for $\\eta(S)$ were tested. Simulation results showed that the constant-type $\\eta(S)$ better fits experimental data, especially at low $S^0$ concentrations, indicating that $S^0$ oxidation kinetics are governed by particle transfer rate (morphology, size, enzymes) rather than concentration.\n\n### 5. Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis\n- **Weighted nonlinear least-squares analysis** was used to construct the objective function $F(P)$\n- **Monte Carlo method** was used to optimize parameters\n- **95% confidence intervals** were calculated for all 9 parameters\n- **Sensitivity analysis** was performed to evaluate parameter identifiability\n\n### 6. Model Calibration and Validation\n- Calibrated using experimental Data sets I and III (from the authors' SBR reactor and An et al. (2010))\n- Validated against Data sets II and IV (independent datasets at different S/N ratios)\n- The stoichiometric matrix (Table S1) was constructed to systematically organize all process kinetics",
    "CLAUDE_Summarize_the_main_points_of_the_paper": "## Summary of Main Points\n\nThis paper presents the development, calibration, and validation of a **kinetic mathematical model for the autotrophic denitrification (AD) process using sulphide ($S^{2-}$) as electron donor**, published in *Water Research* (2016). The key contributions and findings are:\n\n### 1. Novel Two-Step AD Kinetic Model\n- A model comprising **4 processes** (A: $S^{2-}$ oxidation to $S^0$ coupled with $NO_3^- \\rightarrow NO_2^-$; B: $S^{2-}$ oxidation coupled with $NO_2^- \\rightarrow N_2$; C: $S^0$ oxidation coupled with $NO_3^- \\rightarrow NO_2^-$; D: $S^0$ oxidation coupled with $NO_2^- \\rightarrow N_2$), **5 components** ($S^{2-}$, $S^0$, $SO_4^{2-}$, $NO_3^-$, $NO_2^-$), and **9 parameters** was developed\n- Stoichiometric coefficients were derived from the **electron equivalents partitioning framework** ($f_e + f_s = 1$)\n- **Double Monod-type kinetics** were used to describe ADB growth as a function of both electron donor and electron acceptor concentrations\n\n### 2. Constant-Type $\\eta(S)$ for Elemental Sulphur Kinetics\n- Comparison between Monod-type and constant-type expressions for the sulphur term $\\eta(S)$ showed that the **constant-type $\\eta(S)$ better describes the AD process**\n- This indicates that $S^0$ oxidation rate is not governed by $S^0$ concentration but rather by particle transfer rate, morphology, size, and enzymatic activity\n\n### 3. Model Calibration and Validation\n- The model was calibrated using two independent datasets (from the authors' SBR reactor and An et al. (2010))\n- Validated against two additional independent datasets at different S/N molar ratios\n- Good agreement between model predictions and experimental data for $S^{2-}$, $S^0$, $SO_4^{2-}$, $NO_3^-$-N, and $NO_2^-$-N profiles was demonstrated\n\n### 4. Parameter Identifiability\n- Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis showed that $\\mu_{AD}$, $f_{S^{2-}}^1$, $f_{S^0}^1$, $K_{NO_3}$, and $\\eta(S)$ are the most sensitive and identifiable parameters\n- $K_{NO_2}$ had the largest confidence interval (206.8%), indicating lower identifiability\n- Optimum values: $\\mu_{AD}$ = 0.5102 d$^{-1}$, $K_{NO_3}$ = 109.7 mg $NO_3^-$-N/L, $\\eta(S)$ = 0.3322\n\n### 5. Practical Application for Effluent Control\n- The model enables **accurate prediction of $S^0$ and $SO_4^{2-}$ concentrations** in real time, providing a strategy to:\n  - Control $SO_4^{2-}$ concentration below discharge limits\n  - Recover $S^0$ as the main end product from sulphide biooxidation by terminating the AD process at the appropriate time\n\n### 6. Long-term Reactor Performance\n- The SBR AD reactor achieved stable operation after 50 days, with nitrate removal efficiency of $82 \\pm 5.7\\%$ and $S^{2-}$ concentration in effluent below detection limit over one year of operation",
    "CLAUDE_What_are_the_points_that_can_be_explored_further": "## Points That Can Be Explored Further\n\n- **Incorporation of inhibition effects**: This study excluded inhibition of $NO_2^-$ and $S^{2-}$ on sulphide oxidation because concentrations were below inhibitory thresholds (>800 mg/L for $NO_2^-$, >500 mg/L for $S^{2-}$). Future models should incorporate inhibition kinetics for systems operating at higher concentrations, enabling broader applicability.\n\n- **Mechanistic understanding of $\\eta(S)$**: The paper found that $\\eta(S)$ is best described as a constant rather than a Monod-type function, suggesting it is controlled by $S^0$ particle morphology, size, and related enzymes rather than concentration. Further research is needed to mechanistically quantify how particle characteristics and enzymatic activity govern $\\eta(S)$.\n\n- **Extension to continuous flow reactors**: The model was developed and validated using SBR batch data. Its applicability to continuous flow systems (e.g., CSTR, fixed-bed, biofilm reactors) should be tested and potentially adapted.\n\n- **Integration with ASM framework**: The current model is standalone. Integrating it into the broader ASM (Activated Sludge Model) framework would allow simultaneous simulation of heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification in mixed systems, which is common in real wastewater treatment plants.\n\n- **Temperature and pH effects on kinetic parameters**: The model was developed at a fixed temperature ($30°C$) and pH (~7.2). Temperature and pH correction factors (e.g., Arrhenius-type) should be incorporated to extend the model's applicability to varying environmental conditions, as cross-effects of temperature, pH, and free ammonia on AD have been reported.\n\n- **Microbial community dynamics**: The model uses a lumped ADB biomass ($X_{AD}$) without distinguishing between different sulphur-oxidizing denitrifying species. Incorporating microbial community structure and population dynamics could improve model accuracy and mechanistic insight.\n\n- **Real-time monitoring and control strategy**: The paper suggests using the model to control $SO_4^{2-}$ below discharge limits or recover $S^0$. A practical real-time control algorithm based on model predictions needs to be developed and tested, especially since in-situ $S^0$ measurement remains challenging.\n\n- **Thiosulphate ($S_2O_3^{2-}$) and other sulphur intermediates**: This study excluded thiosulphate and sulphite as they were identified as chemical oxidation intermediates rather than biodenitrification intermediates. However, in other AD systems (e.g., using $S_2O_3^{2-}$ as electron donor), these compounds play central roles and should be modeled.\n\n- **Decay coefficient inclusion**: The decay term was excluded because its value was very small ($10^{-5}$ to $10^{-6}$ h$^{-1}$) in batch tests. For long-term continuous operation modeling, including decay and endogenous respiration may improve accuracy.\n\n- **Sulphur recovery optimization**: The model's ability to predict $S^0$ production opens opportunities for optimizing sulphur recovery as a valuable by-product. Process optimization studies combining the model with economic analysis could be explored.",

    "CLAUDE_What_problem_does_this_paper_attempt_to_solve": "## What Problem Does This Paper Attempt to Solve?\n\nThe paper addresses the following key problems:\n\n- **Lack of mathematical model for autotrophic denitrification (AD) with sulphide as electron donor**: Existing denitrification models (e.g., ASM series from IWA) are designed for heterotrophic denitrification (HDN) and cannot adequately describe the AD process, which has fundamentally different metabolic pathways and microbial communities.\n\n- **Inability to predict and control sulphide biooxidation end products**: In the AD process using sulphide ($S^{2-}$), the oxidation products include elemental sulphur ($S^0$) and sulphate ($SO_4^{2-}$). The $SO_4^{2-}$ concentration in effluent often exceeds discharge limits, and there is no reliable quantitative tool to predict or control the ratio of $S^0$ to $SO_4^{2-}$ produced.\n\n- **Oversimplified kinetics in previous studies**: Prior kinetic studies of AD used zero-, half-, or first-order reaction models without considering microbial growth, which failed to simulate the complex AD process accurately. Additionally, the kinetics of elemental sulphur ($S^0$) oxidation were not well characterized or validated.\n\n- **Unclear expression of the sulphur term $\\eta(S)$**: Whether the kinetic role of elemental sulphur ($S^0$) in the AD process follows a Monod-type concentration-dependent expression or a constant-type expression was unresolved, limiting accurate modeling of nitrate, nitrite, sulphur, and sulphate dynamics.\n\n- **Absence of a two-step AD model considering nitrite as an intermediate**: Previous simplified models only considered single-step nitrate reduction ($NO_3^- \\rightarrow N_2$) without accounting for nitrite ($NO_2^-$) as an important intermediate, reducing their applicability to real AD systems.",

    "CLAUDE_zh_What_are_the_points_that_can_be_explored_further": "## 可进一步探索的方向\n\n- **纳入抑制效应**：本研究因浓度低于抑制阈值（$NO_2^-$ > 800 mg/L，$S^{2-}$ > 500 mg/L）而未考虑抑制效应。未来模型应纳入高浓度条件下的抑制动力学，以扩大适用范围。\n\n- **$\\eta(S)$的机理研究**：本文发现$\\eta(S)$以常数型表达更为合适，表明其受$S^0$颗粒形态、粒径和相关酶活性控制，而非浓度控制。需要进一步研究以定量描述颗粒特性和酶活性对$\\eta(S)$的影响机制。\n\n- **推广至连续流反应器**：模型基于SBR批次数据开发和验证，其在连续流系统（如CSTR、固定床、生物膜反应器）中的适用性有待测试和调整。\n\n- **与ASM框架的整合**：当前模型为独立模型，将其整合到ASM框架中，可实现混合系统中异养和自养反硝化的同步模拟，这在实际污水处理厂中十分常见。\n\n- **温度和pH对动力学参数的影响**：模型在固定温度（$30°C$）和pH（~7.2）下建立，应引入温度和pH校正因子（如Arrhenius型），以扩展模型在不同环境条件下的适用性。\n\n- **微生物群落动态**：模型使用聚合的ADB生物量（$X_{AD}$），未区分不同硫氧化反硝化菌种。纳入微生物群落结构和种群动态可提高模型精度和机理认识。\n\n- **实时监测与控制策略**：本文建议利用模型控制$SO_4^{2-}$低于排放限值或回收$S^0$，但实用的实时控制算法尚需开发和验证，尤其是$S^0$的原位实时监测仍面临挑战。\n\n- **硫代硫酸盐（$S_2O_3^{2-}$）及其他硫中间产物**：本研究将硫代硫酸盐和亚硫酸盐排除在外，认为其为化学氧化中间产物而非生物反硝化中间产物。但在以$S_2O_3^{2-}$为电子供体的其他AD系统中，这些化合物起核心作用，应纳入建模。\n\n- **衰减系数的纳入**：由于批次实验中衰减系数极小（$10^{-5}$至$10^{-6}$ h$^{-1}$），本文未纳入衰减项。对于长期连续运行的建模，纳入衰减和内源呼吸可提高精度。\n\n- **硫磺回收优化**：模型预测$S^0$产量的能力为将硫磺作为有价值副产品进行回收提供了机会，可结合经济分析开展过程优化研究。",
