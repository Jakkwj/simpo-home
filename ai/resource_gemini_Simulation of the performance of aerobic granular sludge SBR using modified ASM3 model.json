    "Abstract": "The activated sludge model No. 3 (ASM3) was modified to describe the biological reactions in aerobic granular sludge SBR. The simultaneous storage and growth, nitrification and denitrification were all accounted for in modified model. The sensitivities of effluent COD, NH4+–N, and TN toward the stoichiometric and kinetic coefficients were analyzed. A standard set of parameters obtained from a combination of literature data was chosen for the model. The experimental results for the time profile of COD, NH4+–N, and TN in a typical cycle were used to verify the ASM3 model. The verification results show the model established is applicable for simulating the performance of an aerobic granule-based SBR. A comparison of the measured and predicted values of substrate removal for both the modified ASM3 and the original ASM3 was also performed. The verification and comparison results show the modified ASM3 model describes the aerobic granule-based SBR better and more mechanistically.",
    "GEMINI_What_problem_does_this_paper_attempt_to_solve": "- The original ASM3 model has limitations in describing the performance of aerobic granular sludge in Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBRs).\\n- ASM3 assumes all readily biodegradable substrates are taken up first and stored as internal cell polymers before growth, which fails to describe the simultaneous feast-famine behavior (simultaneous storage and growth) in SBRs.\\n- ASM3 assumes nitrification and denitrification are single-step processes, neglecting nitrite ($NO_2^-$) as an intermediate product, which is significant when nitrite accumulates in aerobic granular systems.",
    "GEMINI_How_the_paper_solves_this_problem": "- Modified the ASM3 model by introducing the concept of simultaneous aerobic/anoxic storage and growth of organic substrates by heterotrophic bacteria.\\n- Incorporated a two-step nitrification and denitrification process, including nitrite as an intermediate compound.\\n- Replaced the original autotrophic biomass ($X_A$) with two new model compounds: ammonium oxidizing bacteria ($X_{AOB}$) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria ($X_{NOB}$).\\n- Constructed a modified model with 13 components and 22 microbial processes, summarized in a matrix format.\\n- Conducted sensitivity analysis to evaluate and calibrate 11 important kinetic and stoichiometric parameters.\\n- Implemented the model using Matlab and verified it against experimental data from a laboratory-scale granular sludge SBR.",
    "GEMINI_What_experiments_were_done_for_the_paper": "- Operated a laboratory-scale Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) with a working volume of 8 L, fed with synthetic wastewater.\\n- Cultivated aerobic granules from activated sludge.\\n- Measured chemical oxygen demand (COD), $NH_4^+-N$, total nitrogen (TN), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH during the steady state.\\n- Conducted a typical cycle experiment (2 min feeding, 354 min aeration, 3 min settling, 1 min effluent discharge) to obtain time-profile data for COD, $NH_4^+-N$, and TN.\\n- Performed model simulation, sensitivity analysis, calibration, and verification using the experimental data.",
    "GEMINI_What_are_the_points_that_can_be_explored_further": "- The deviation in the simulated TN concentration compared to measured values suggests that the denitrification process or simultaneous nitrification-denitrification (SND) mechanisms inside the granules could be further refined.\\n- The model could be extended to include phosphorus removal processes (e.g., integrating ASM2d features).\\n- Spatial distribution of microorganisms and mass transfer limitations (diffusion) within the 3D structure of the aerobic granules could be incorporated for a more mechanistic multi-scale model.\\n- Validation of the modified model using real municipal or industrial wastewater instead of synthetic wastewater.",
    "GEMINI_Summarize_the_main_points_of_the_paper": "- A modified ASM3 model was successfully developed to simulate the biological conversion processes in an aerobic granular sludge SBR.\\n- The modifications included simultaneous storage-growth and two-step nitrification-denitrification (via nitrite).\\n- Sensitivity analysis identified 11 key parameters that significantly influence COD, $NH_4^+-N$, and TN outputs, which were then calibrated.\\n- The modified model showed excellent agreement with experimental data (99.7% for COD, 97.9% for $NH_4^+-N$, and 92.4% for TN).\\n- Compared to the original ASM3, the modified model provided a much more accurate and mechanistic description of the rapid COD removal and nitrogen dynamics in the aerobic granule-based SBR.",
