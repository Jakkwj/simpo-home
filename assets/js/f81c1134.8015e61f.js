To maximize plotting efficiency, we\'ve introduced multiprocessing (leveraging multi-core CPUs for parallel processing) to accelerate this process.\\n\\nHowever, in certain specific scenarios, multiprocessing plotting can trigger a `BrokenProcessPool` error, leading to plotting interruptions. To address this critical issue, we\'ve optimized the plotting functionality in **SIMPO 1.0.1**.\\nThis version ensures that when the program encounters this error, it will **automatically switch to the main process**, guaranteeing the completion of the plotting procedure.\\n\\n### System Platform Differences and Recommendations\\n\\nWe\'ve observed that `BrokenProcessPool` errors are more common on **Windows** (and rare on **Ubuntu**).\\nThis is likely due to the difference in how `Windows` uses `spawn` to start child processes, whereas `Linux` typically uses `fork`.\\n\\nConsequently, users on **Ubuntu** systems generally benefit from **faster computation speeds, more stable multiprocessing operations, and better compatibility**.\\n\\n**For a smoother, faster, and more stable computing experience, we strongly recommend performing SIMPO computations within an Ubuntu environment.**\\n\\n\\n\\n{/*\\n1.

However, as these models become increasingly complex, their development, application, and validation pose significant challenges for researchers, engineers, and even peer reviewers. Traditional software often suffers from steep learning curves, cumbersome operations, a lack of collaborative features, and high costs. This not only hinders the widespread adoption and innovation of these models but also restricts the application and improvement of water treatment technologies in developing countries. Addressing this critical need, the author\'s team has developed SIMPO\u2014 **a free, zero-barrier, open, and shareable SaaS cloud platform**. The platform aims to significantly lower the threshold for wastewater treatment process modeling through a **code-free, drag-and-drop graphical interface**, while integrating advanced algorithms to ensure the **professionalism, accuracy, and reliability** of the models.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Visual Guide\\n\\n\\n### SIMPO Makes Water Treatment Process Modeling as Simple as \\"Building Blocks\\"\\n\\nCompared to traditional modeling software like AQUASIM, SIMPO offers a simpler, more convenient, and smoother modeling process. SIMPO simplifies complex modeling into intuitive drag-and-drop operations, combined with an AI-driven core for model building, achieving \\"zero-barrier\\" modeling:\\n\\n\\n- **AQUASIM**: Users must manually input variables, define processes, partition units, set connections, configure time steps, and edit plots within multi-level dialog boxes, resulting in a complex and non-intuitive workflow.\\n- **SIMPO**: Users only need to follow three straightforward steps: \\"Edit Model (BioModel)\\" \u2192 \\"Drag-and-Drop to Build Process (DataSet)\\" \u2192 \\"Automatically Generate Project and Calculate (Project)\\". The platform automatically handles time stepping and result plotting.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\" style={{marginTop: \\"0.2vh\\", marginBottom: \\"0.8vh\\"}}>\\n  <img src=\\"https://www.sciengine.com/figures/figures-784f9fa441e14493b33139be33fd10a5-3050-4724-2025-1-4-201-F001c.jpg\\"  width=\\"100%\\"/>\\n    <div style={{fontSize: \\"0.8rem\\"}}>Figure 1.

SIMPO, by leveraging large language models such as Gemini 3, can automatically read text and diagrams from research papers to generate biochemical models (Biomodel).\\n\\n### Accuracy and Performance Guaranteed\\n\\nThe reliability of a new tool must be rigorously validated. The research team selected a classic case study to compare SIMPO\'s simulation results against the industry benchmark software, AQUASIM.\\n\\n**As shown in Figure 4**, in batch and continuous reactor simulations of the biological nutrient removal model, SIMPO\'s simulation curves almost perfectly overlap with those of AQUASIM, achieving a weighted Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (WNSE) above 0.999.
