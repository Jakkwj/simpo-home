# 2022





## 2022-05-11
- Changed
  - Match with web version refine.





## 2022-04-13
- Fixed
  - Fixed lots of bugs and Test lots of situation, seems ok
- Changed
  - Fortran input parameters should not get initial value in declaration. If you set a initial value to a parameter in declaration, it will get "save" effect, everytime OpenMP call Get_Kernel_Evaluation(), this parameter will be accumulated.
  - Component in Get_Kernel_Evaluation() has been set to intent(in).
  - BioComponent_rollback also gets detection_limit to prevent Grid_dt_second become 0 under Forward_Euler condiction.


## 2022-03-24
- Changed
  - Inflow and flow evaluation seems ok.
  - Improved fortran code under evaluation condiction:
    - Evaluation scope now has 5 parts:
      - paramter
      - initial value of component
      - volume
      - initial value of inflow
      - initial value of flow
    - Input module will not assign if the scope are all false, for example, if we are conducting OAT evaluation, and all paramters are False (not evaluated), then, Parameter_OAT will not appear in Input and main_Evaluation module. In this case, computer memory will be saved a little, and increase some calculation speed.




## 2022-03-22
- Trying
  - Trying inflow and flow evaluation




## 2022-02-20
- Changed
  - Fixed result_pro.py bugs in result_file initial.
    - Initial result_file will be created correctly right now.
    - Result_file will be close correctly right now.





## 2022-02-19
- Addded
  - Making solution_pro._get_group().
