# 2022

## 2022-05-20

- Changed
  - DataSet empty input seems ok.

## 2022-05-11

- Improved
  - Match with web version improve.

## 2022-05-02

- Changed
  - Solution Weight input format changed.

## 2022-04-26

- Added
  - solution.\_check_matrix_initial_value(), to avoid a division by zero error.
- Changed
  - DataSet.Flow can be empty.

## 2022-04-13

- Added
  - Unit and Target has been seperated in DataSet input excel file.
  - Target has been seperated in Solution input excel file.
- Fixed
  - Fixed lots of bugs and Test lots of situation, seems ok

## 2022-04-05

- Added
  - Target in DataSet.Inflow will be converted to Component:
    - Loop each Inflow, if there are targets which cannot find in component, convert them
    - Find the sum relation in Solution.conversion, and then find the proportional relationship in Solution.variable
    - Inflow will convert all the targets into components
    - Then, Inflow will be calculation correctly
    - If all the targets in Inflow are the same as components, then it won't convert.
  - Unit will be add in Component plotter.

## 2022-03-22

- Added
  - Trying inflow and flow evaluation
- Trying
  - trying inflow and flow evaluation

## 2022-02-23

- Changed
  - Logic of Grouping has changed a lot:
    - A BioModel.Matrix Group describes the sum of some Components equal to a certain value in any circumstances. A Group is actually a constraint, so Group Components cannot be simply random when conducting LHS/GA evaluation.
    - A BioModel.Matrix Group cannot contain overlap Components and Components value must be number (not a Parameter), cause we don't support this kind of evaluation yet.
    - Solution.Varable Group Sum of Component_Tank must be equal to DataSet.Measured Target initial value, and must be equal to corresponding Group Sum (default Group Sum) in BioModel.Matrix Group.
    - Only a BioModel.Matrix Group will be sync with Evaluation status (solution_pro.\_sync_group_component_evaluation()), rather than a Group from Solution.Conversion.

## 2022-02-20

- Changed
  - Fixed result.py bugs in result_file initial
    - Result_file will be close correctly right now.

## 2022-02-19

- Changed
  - Upgrading grouping comment in biomodel.\_get_group().

## 2022-01-23

- Added
  - Add Component sheet in BioModel input xlsx file:
    - Add Unit and Name infomation in Component sheet.
    - Unit will be used in plot later.
    - Component order and name must be exactly the same as in Matrix sheet
  - Add Typer class in Checker to wrap some common type, such as pd.DataFrame can be use as Typer.df
- Changed
  - improve some checker

## 2022-01-03

- Changed
  - The motive of calculation.detection_limit (`1.0e-30` by default) has changed:
    - Now calculation.detection_limit forces the biocomponent equal to it while biocomponent less than it.
    - For instance: if `biocomponent(1) < 1.0e-30`, then `biocomponent(1) = 1.0e-30`.
    - By this way, it will make steady state easier (hopefully).
    - NOTE: this method has not been tested yet.
