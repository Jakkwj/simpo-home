## Massive AI Upgrade: A New Chapter with 6 Top LLMs Integrated!

Hello, Fellow Researchers! **SIMPO** is thrilled to announce a significant upgrade, dramatically expanding our support for **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This empowers you to achieve unprecedented efficiency in model construction and literature interpretation!

---

### Introducing 6 Leading Large Language Models!

We've successfully integrated the following six industry-leading LLMs, enriching your research toolkit with more powerful capabilities:

*   **Gemini 3.1 Pro**
*   **Gemini 3.0 Pro**
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash**
*   **Claude 4.6 Sonnet**
*   **Claude 4.5 Sonnet**
*   **Claude 3.5 Haiku**

Your dedicated AI powerhouse is now officially online! These cutting-edge AI models are ready to be your indispensable research assistants:

1.  **Instant PDF Paper Comprehension, One-Click BioModel Generation:** Upload your PDF papers directly, select one of the **LLM models** for intelligent interpretation, and quickly generate new **BioModels**. This eliminates tedious manual input, making knowledge transformation more efficient!
2.  **In-depth Paper Analysis to Boost Research:** Now, in Resource, **Claude 4.6 Sonnet** and **Gemini 3.1 Pro** offer precise paper interpretation, helping you effortlessly grasp research frontiers and uncover potential insights!

---

### Enhanced Experience! Optimizations and Fixes for a Smoother Workflow

Beyond the robust AI model support, we've also implemented various optimizations and bug fixes to ensure a more fluid and stable user experience:

*   **Smarter Creation:** When creating new blank **BioModels** and **DataSets**, the initial content is now more comprehensive. This allows you to directly create new **Projects** from these templates and begin calculations immediately, saving you pre-configuration time!
*   **Classic Model Filtering:** A new `Classic` button has been added to the **BioModel**'s **Public** page. Click to filter and display only classic models, making your search quicker and more focused!
*   **Updated Example:** The `AQUASIM T2P17` calculation example has been updated, providing the latest demonstration to assist your learning and practice.
*   **Formula Input Optimization:** Resolved spacing issues during formula input, ensuring your formulas are more standardized and input is smoother.
*   **Navigation Fix:** Fixed an issue where clicking `Quick Start`/`Changelog`/`Resource` did not navigate correctly when the left sidebar was minimized, ensuring a more stable navigation experience.
*   **Table Sorting Resolved:** Fixed a sorting error in the **Personal** table for **BioModel/DataSet/Project** when clicking the `Cloned` column header, leading to more accurate data management.
*   **Library Query Fix:** Resolved query errors for **Components** and **Parameters** in the **Library**, allowing you to find required resources more accurately.

Thank you for your continued support! We invite you to explore these new features and let AI accelerate your research endeavors!
