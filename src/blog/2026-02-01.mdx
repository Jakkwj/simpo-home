  **SIMPO**, initiated by Professor Jiang Feng's team at the School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, is a no-code intelligent modeling  and sharing platform for mathematical simulation of wastewater treatment. For specific update details, please see: [SIMPO 1.0.1 Changelog](http://www.simpowater.com/zh/changelog/SIMPO%20Client/2026)。

### Plotting Functionality Optimized for Enhanced Stability

In **SIMPO**, after each computation, the program automatically generates a series of complex graphics based on the calculation engine. To maximize plotting efficiency, we've introduced multiprocessing (leveraging multi-core CPUs for parallel processing) to accelerate this process.

However, in certain specific scenarios, multiprocessing plotting can trigger a `BrokenProcessPool` error, leading to plotting interruptions. To address this critical issue, we've optimized the plotting functionality in **SIMPO 1.0.1**.
This version ensures that when the program encounters this error, it will **automatically switch to the main process**, guaranteeing the completion of the plotting procedure.

### System Platform Differences and Recommendations

We've observed that `BrokenProcessPool` errors are more common on **Windows** (and rare on **Ubuntu**).
This is likely due to the difference in how `Windows` uses `spawn` to start child processes, whereas `Linux` typically uses `fork`.

Consequently, users on **Ubuntu** systems generally benefit from **faster computation speeds, more stable multiprocessing operations, and better compatibility**.

**For a smoother, faster, and more stable computing experience, we strongly recommend performing SIMPO computations within an Ubuntu environment.**
