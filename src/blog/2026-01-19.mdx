Today, we are thrilled to announce the **official release of SIMPO version 1.0.0!**

This is a "major version upgrade" in the truest sense of the word:
From the core to the interface, from algorithms to the user experience,
we have systematically enhanced **modeling efficiency**, **computational power**, and **usability**.
More importantly, we've integrated cutting-edge **AI** capabilities, aiming to elevate the efficiency of building mathematical models for wastewater treatment processes to an **entirely new dimension**.

   **SIMPO**, initiated by Professor Jiang Feng's team at the School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, is a no-code intelligent modeling  and sharing platform for mathematical simulation of wastewater treatment. For specific update details, please see: [SIMPO 1.0.0 Changelog](http://www.simpowater.com/zh/changelog/SIMPO%20Client/2026).

## Release Highlights

### Highlight 1: AI-Powered, Directly Convert Papers to Models, Speed Skyrockets

Still manually transferring model parameters from papers into the software one by one? Not anymore.

**SIMPO 1.0.0** now fully integrates with **Gemini 3**. You can now simply drag and drop your SCI paper's PDF file into the software, and the AI will automatically parse and extract key information, generating a **BioModel** with a single click!
*   **Workflow:** Import PDF -> AI Parsing -> Simple Human Verification -> Model Ready.
*   **Result:** Modeling work that used to take hours is now done in minutes.

In a nutshell: The process from "paper" to "computable model" has been significantly compressed, especially suitable for scenarios requiring rapid replication of literature models, batch modeling, or team collaboration and sharing.

### Highlight 2: pH Calculation, Mastered!
**pH calculation** has never been as simple as "inputting a formula": ionic speciation, dissociation equilibrium, quantitative descriptions… each step is prone to pitfalls.

To address this, we've built the **Ionization** module within **BioModel**. Now, you only need to provide quantitative descriptions for each ion, and SIMPO can effortlessly and accurately perform complex pH calculations. No more manually setting up equations; let the software handle chemical equilibrium.

### Highlight 3: Performance Surges, Silky Smooth
In pursuit of ultimate performance, we've made numerous "invisible" yet "delightful to use" improvements, resulting in significant **enhancements in access speed and computational efficiency**:
*   **Kernel Upgrade:** Python version upgraded from **3.11.9 to 3.12.12**.
*   **Backend Refactor:** Backend migrated from **FastAPI** to the more efficient **Litestar**.
*   **Domain Migration:** [https://www.simpowater.org]() → [https://www.simpowater.com](), offering faster and smoother access.
*   **Algorithm Optimization:** Verified that the adjusted **Forward Euler** algorithm achieves extremely high accuracy even with a very low Step Tolerance (0.01%). Therefore, we've removed the redundant Improved Euler, making calculations purer and faster.

## User Experience Enhancements: Details Make the Difference
Beyond the hardcore features mentioned above, we've also adjusted and optimized numerous pain points to make your experience smoother:
*   **Share Without Login:** `Public` and `Private` projects now support login-free access, making it easier to share your results with supervisors or colleagues.
*   **More Intuitive Workflow:** `Edit` and `Export` buttons have been moved to the `Detail` page, eliminating the need for frequent page switching.
*   **Function Operations:** `Rate` in `BioModel` now supports functions: `Max` and `Min` (Max(1, 5) = 5, Min(1, 5) = 1).
*   **Input Optimization:** Backspace will no longer unintentionally exit the page when unsaved, providing a more secure input experience.
*   **Download Optimization:** Client download size significantly reduced (installation time is slightly longer than before).
*   **Page Optimizations:**
    *   Better adaptive support for various screen sizes.
    *   Collapsible left-side menu in the Dashboard: More usable space.
    *   Top pop-up notifications no longer overlap: Clearer information.
*   **Significant Enhancements to Plotting:**
    *   Local plotting resource usage significantly reduced, with smoother image switching via mouse/keyboard.
    *   Supports **SVG vector image** export, directly meeting publication requirements.
    *   Axis, line width, and legend positions are all finely customizable.
