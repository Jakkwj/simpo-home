版本**0.12.0**发布。

该版本的主要成果是 **pH 计算**。

- 添加

  - 添加 pH 计算的支持。
  - 添加 在 BioModel Rate 中的 Min/Max 函数的支持。
  - 现在可以将 Simulation/Sensitivity/Uncertainty/Estimation 的图表结果导出为 SVG 格式。
  - Band/Density/Skeleton/PCD/VariableNSE 的 SVG 格式将保存在本地，PNG 格式将被移除。

- 修复

  - 现在 Calculation Time 将与 DataSet Measured Time 相同。
  - 删除 Client Project Dir 前先进行确认是否存在。

- 更改
  - 删除 Improved Euler （Forward Euler 已经足够）。 -->

Version **1.0.0** has been released.

The major achievements of this version include:

- Support for creating `BioModel` using **Gemini 3**.
- Support for **pH** calculation.
- Upgraded `Python` version from `3.11.9` to `3.12.12`.
- Migrated backend framework from `fastapi` to `litestar`.
- Migrated website URL from [https://www.simpowater.org]() to [https://www.simpowater.com](), accessing the old URL will automatically redirect to the new one.

---

- **Added**
  - Added support for creating new `BioModel` by automatically parsing **SCI Paper PDFs** via **AI** (**Gemini 3**).
  - Added support for **pH** calculation; related parameters are configured in `BioModel.Ionization`.
  - Calculation results can now be downloaded in **SVG** image format.
  - `Public` and `Private` release can now be accessed without logging in.
  - The local Real-Time Plotting window now supports switching images using the left/right mouse buttons or keyboard keys, and the aspect ratio is maintained during switching.

- **Changed**
  - **Improved Euler** will no longer be supported. Equivalent computational accuracy can be achieved (more quickly) by reducing the **Step Tolerance** of **Forward Euler**.

- **Improved**
  - Significantly reduced client download size.
  - Optimized the Real-Time Plotting function for reduced memory and CPU consumption.
  - Optimized frontend pages with better support for responsive design (adaptive screens).
  - Moved `Edit` and `Export` buttons from the `Profile` page to the `Detail` page.
  - `BioModel` and `DataSet` can now be `Edit`ed and `Export`ed directly from the `Project.Detail` page.
  - Optimized formula input in matrices such as `BioModel.Matrix` and `Project.Conversion`.
  - The `Dashboard` left sidebar now supports collapsing, the collapsed state is automatically saved upon page refresh.
  - Removed scientific notation from axes in locally saved **SVG** images.
  - Disabled the **Backspace** key's navigation back function to prevent accidental page exit before saving formula inputs.
  - Top popup notification contents no longer overlap.
  - `Project.Calculation` plotting results now allow fine-grained control and state saving, including:
    - Axis range settings.
    - Line width and symbol size.
    - Width of the plotting result.
    - Legend position.

- **Fixed**
  - `Project.Calculation.Console` now correctly retrieves logs.
  - `Project.Targets` are now saved correctly.
  - `Inflow` Figure is now displayed correctly.
  - `BioModel`/`DataSet`/`Project` can now be deleted correctly.
  - Fixed an issue where the last point in locally saved **SVG** images was sometimes not drawn correctly.
  - The Real-Time Plotting window now refreshes correctly.
  - The taskbar icon for the Real-Time Plotting window now displays correctly.
  - Fixed some known bugs.
