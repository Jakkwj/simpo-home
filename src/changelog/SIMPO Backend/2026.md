# 2026

## 2026-02-18

- **Improved**
  - Improved the content of newly created blank `BioModel`, which is now a complete matrix that has passed balance validation. Results can be directly calculated when newly creating a blank `Project`.
  - Improved newly created blank `DataSet`. Now, when selecting `Targets`, the second row of measured data within the Tank will be added, enabling direct calculation of `Uncertainty` and `Estimation` when newly creating a blank `Project`.

- **Fixed**
  - `figure_data_stream_body()` supplements the handling when Inflow has only one Component.
  - Fixed an issue when newly creating a blank `DataSet`. Now, creating a new `Layout` as `Batch` and selecting `Targets` simultaneously will not create a blank `Inflow`.

## 2026-02-16

- **Fixed**
  - Attempted to fix `The garbage collector is trying to clean up non-checked-in connection <AdaptedConnection <asyncpg.connection.Connection object at 0x7f80f4b40e60>>, which will be terminated. Please ensure that SQLAlchemy pooled connections are returned to the pool explicitly, either by calling `close()` or by using appropriate context managers to manage their lifecycle`.

## 2026-01-02

- **Improved**
  - Migrated backend framework from `fastapi` to `litestar`.

- **Fixed**
  - Fixed some known bugs.
