  - If a Rate expression does contain a Component, and it become negative, the calculation will be stopped.
  - If a Rate expression's denominator is 0, the calculation will be stopped.

## 2024-05-04

Version **0.0.3.7** has been released.

The major achievement of this version is the raw input data of Measured/Inflow/Flow can be compressed by setting the resolution rate (retention rate of raw data). If you set the resolution to 10%, it will only calculation the raw 10% data (even interval), so you can speed up a lot if you don't need so much high precision.

- Added

  - Add time index resolution rate to compress raw Measured/Inflow/Flow data
  - Add auto_plot_correlation to skip plot_OAT_Corr(), since this could take a very long time if data is large.

- Fixed
  - Fixed some known bugs.

## 2024-04-25
